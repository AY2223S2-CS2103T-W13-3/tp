### Project: Clock-Work

Clock-Work is a desktop application for managing tasks and assignments, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Clock-Work can get your
assignment management tasks done faster than traditional GUI applications.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
