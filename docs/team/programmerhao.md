### Project:Clock-Work

Clock-Work is a desktop application for managing tasks and assignments, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Clock-Work can get your assignment management tasks done faster than traditional GUI applications.
